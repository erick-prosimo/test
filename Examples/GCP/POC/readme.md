# Editing Templates

## Step 1:
---
Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file with the settings you want deployed.

## Step 2:
---
Save and commit the change to trigger the pipeline run.

## Step 3: (Optional)
---
If you want to edit the file, but not trigger a pipeline run use `norun` as the commit message.
